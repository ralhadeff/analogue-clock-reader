Project to generate a convolutional neuron network that can read an analogue clock

Work in progress  


Training is performed on randomly generated images (64x64, in RGB).  

`1-hand` - Only the hour's hand has been implemented. One example image has been uploaded in the folder.  

`2-hands` - Hours and minutes hands implemented (at 5 minutes intervals).
